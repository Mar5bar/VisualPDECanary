We now study the [Cahn–Hilliard equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation) with an extra reaction term,

$$\pd{u}{t} = \nabla^2 (r\left[u^3-u\right]-\epsilon\nabla^2u),$$

with periodic boundary conditions.

- Load the [interactive simulation](/sim/?preset=CahnHilliard)

- Observe the coarsening process as described in this [2001 article](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/pdectb/cahn2.pdf) from an initially random configuration. 

- Vary the lengthscale of the interfaces between regions by changing the value of $\epsilon$, and vary the parameter $r$ to control the influence of a double-well potential on the states attained by $u$.

There are lots of things that you can do with this equation (with or without the reaction term). For instance, you can extend it to a 'non-reciprocal' Cahn–Hilliard system as in [Brauns and Marchetti](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.14.021014), which exhibits pretty patterns that you can play with in this [interactive simulation](/sim/?preset=CahnHilliardNonreciprocal). Thanks to Lloyd Fung for pointing out this example!
