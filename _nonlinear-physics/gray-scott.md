A reaction–diffusion system heavily studied for its complex dynamics is the Gray–Scott system, given by

$$\begin{aligned}\pd{u}{t}&=\nabla^2 u+u^2v - (a+b)u,\\ \pd{v}{t}&=D\nabla^2v-u^2v + a(1 - v),\end{aligned}$$

where we take $D=2$ and only vary $a,b>0$. This model has a [wide range of behaviours](http://www.mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/index.html), shown in [another WebGL simulator](https://pmneila.github.io/jsexp/grayscott/) that partially inspired VisualPDE.

* Load the [interactive simulation](/sim/?preset=GrayScott) to explore the system.
  
A [famous 1993 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/patt-sol/9304003) on this model explored a range of the parameters $a$ and $b$ to classify different behaviours, and many people have hence made these parameters depend linearly on $x$ and $t$ to see all of this behaviour at once. 

* This [classification simulation](/sim/?preset=GrayScottPearsonClassification) explores this approach, with $a$ depending on $y$ in the range $a \in [0,0.07]$ and $b$ depending on $x$ in the range $b \in [0.02, 0.068]$.

Building from the previous simulation, we can rescale the heterogeneity to still be monotonic, but to use up more of the domain to see different dynamical regimes. 

* Explore this in this [rescaled simulation](/sim/?preset=GrayScottPearsonClassificationRescaled), where we also plot the variable $v$ instead by default (you can click on {{ layout.views }} to change this to plot $u$ instead). Here is [another version of this rescaled model](/sim/?preset=GrayScottPorousMedia) which also includes a porous-medium diffusion term (that is, $\nabla^2 u^m$), which radically alters the parameter space as $m$ is increased from 1.

Interestingly, the value of $D=2$ used gives a very rich parameter space, whereas making $D$ smaller reduces the regions of patterned behaviour, and taking $D$ larger increases it at the cost of making things more stationary and more spot-like for most of the parameter domain. 

Furthermore, when $D=1$ the system no longer supports stationary patterns, but does exhibit waves similar to the spiral waves in the equal-diffusion case of the [cyclic competition models](/mathematical-biology/cyclic-competition).

Below we've listed some parameter combinations that give rise to different and interesting behaviours. 

One of our favourites is the [moving spots simulation](/sim/?preset=GrayScottGliders), which exhibits spots bobbing around. 

* Initiate this motion and then increase $b$ slowly to about $b=0.56$. The spots become sparse and start exhibiting strange diversions in their motions.
