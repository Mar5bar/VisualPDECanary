One can show that two-species reaction–diffusion systems can only ever have Turing-like instabilities with real growth rates. 

In contrast, hyperbolic reaction–diffusion systems (or systems with more than two species) allow for [Turing and wave](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13820) (or sometimes wave or Turing–Hopf) instabilities. Such instabilities lead to spatial eigenfunctions that grow and oscillate, typically giving rise to spatiotemporal dynamics. 

Here we consider a hyperbolic version of the [Brusselator](/mathematical-biology/brusselator), given by

$$\begin{aligned}\tau\pdd{u}{t}+\pd{u}{t}&=D_u\nabla^2 u+a-(b+1)u+u^2v,\\ \tau\pdd{v}{t}+\pd{v}{t}&=D_v\nabla^2v+ bu-u^2v,\end{aligned}$$

where there are two new terms proportional to $\tau$. 

The normal Turing instabilities will occur for $D_u<D_v$, but new Turing and wave instabilities may occur for $D_u>D_v$, so we set $D_u=D=2$ and $D_v=1$.

* In a [one-dimensional simulation](/sim/?preset=BrusselatorTuringWave1D), an initial cosine perturbation on a small domain leads to an oscillating cosine, which is what linear theory would predict. The system loses this instability as $\tau$ is decreased to $0.1$ or below, with a decaying oscillation amplitude for intermediate values.

* On a larger domain, a [two-dimensional simulation](/sim/?preset=BrusselatorTuringWave2D) exhibits a variety of transient dynamics depending on exactly how the uniform equilibrium is perturbed, culminating in wave–like spatiotemporal behaviour. Again decreasing $\tau$ or increasing $D$ will reduce the effect of the instability, decreasing the amplitude of the solution.

* Here is a [different 1D example](/sim/?preset=TuringWaveFHN) and the [same system in 2D](/sim/?preset=TuringWaveFHN2D) based on the [FitzHugh–Nagumo system](/mathematical-biology/fitzhugh-nagumo). 

For more details on such systems and their generalisations, take a look at [this 2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13820).
