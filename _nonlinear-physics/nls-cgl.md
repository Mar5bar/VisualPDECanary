Here is an implementation of a [(complex) Ginzburg–Landau equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0106115) given by

$$\pd{\psi}{t}=(D_r+\i D_i)\nabla^2 \psi+(a_r+\i a_i)\psi+(b_r+\i b_i)\psi|\psi|^2,$$

where we typically need $b_r,D_r \geq 0$ for solutions to exist.

* Load the [interactive simulation](/sim/?preset=complexGinzburgLandau) 

* Change the parameter $b_i$ to see a wide range of interesting behaviours. The values $b_i=-5, -1, 0, 1, 2$ all give distinct dynamical regimes, for example.

# Numerical notes

As in the [Schrödinger equation](/basic-pdes/stabilised-schrodinger), we have to separate out the real and imaginary parts of $\psi$ to simulate it. We write $\psi=u+\i v$ to find

$$\begin{aligned}\pd{u}{t}&=D_r\nabla^2u-D_i\nabla^2 v+a_ru-a_iv+(b_ru-b_iv)(u^2+v^2),\\ 
\pd{v}{t} &= D_i\nabla^2 u+D_r\nabla^2v+a_rv+a_iu+(b_rv+b_iu)(u^2+v^2).
\end{aligned}$$

# Solitons 

The [nonlinear Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) is a special case of this model, typically written as

$$
\i\pd{\psi}{t}=-\nabla^2 \psi+\kappa\psi|\psi|^2.
$$

The sign of $\kappa$ determines if the system is 'focusing' or 'defocusing' and, hence, if we can observe dark or bright [solitons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton).

This [soliton simulation](/sim/?preset=NonlinearSchrodingerSoliton) is an example of a soliton moving to the right at a speed $c$, determined entirely by the initial condition. 

If you change the value of $\kappa$ and restart the simulation, you can observe different behaviours. For example, $\kappa=-1$ gives a defocusing equation, for which the soliton eventually breaks apart into something resembling a moving [Jacobi elliptic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_elliptic_functions). 

We note that the simulator used does not preserve the conserved quantities in this model, so may give spurious or incorrect solutions for some parameters or initial conditions.

# Coupled Ginzburg–Landau systems

We can also consider generalisations of coupled systems, particularly an optics formalism known as 'cross-phase modulation'. Models of this form with cubic nonlinearities look like

$$\begin{aligned}\pd{\psi_1}{t}&=(D_{1r}+\i D_{1i})\nabla^2 \psi_1+(a_{1r}+\i a_{1i})\psi_1+(b_{1r}+\i b_{1i})\psi_1\left( |\psi_1|^2+\alpha_1|\psi_2|^2 \right),\\ \pd{\psi_2}{t}&=(D_{2r}+\i D_{2i})\nabla^2 \psi_2+(a_{2r}+\i a_{2i})\psi_2+(b_{2r}+\i b_{2i})\psi_2\left( |\psi_2|^2+\alpha_2|\psi_1|^2 \right). \end{aligned}$$

The parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ influence how much the two wavefunctions interact with one another. 

If these interactions are strong, either species can be driven to extinction, as described in [a 2019 paper on amplitude death](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02147). 

In intermediate cases, the two wavefunctions may coexist, leading to dynamics where the wavefunctions are nonzero only in separate subsets of the domain, as described in [a 2018 paper on saturable nonlinearities](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aop.2018.07.003). 

* This [separation simulation](/sim/?preset=CoupledCGL) explores these dynamics, where the wavefunctions are locally chaotic but their boundaries are determined by where the other wavefunction is nonzero.
