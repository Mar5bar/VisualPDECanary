Here we look at the  [FitzHugh–Nagumo model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model), given by 

$$\begin{aligned}\pd{u}{t}&=\nabla^2 u +u-u^3-v,\\ \pd{v}{t}&=D\nabla^2v+ \varepsilon_v(u-a_v v-a_z),\end{aligned}$$

where we take $D>1$.

* Load the [FitzHugh–Nagumo simulation](/sim/?preset=FitzHugh-Nagumo) 

* Click in the domain to initiate a pattern-forming instability, which will form roughly concentric rings as it expands.

* This system has many different kinds of solutions which are stable over long time periods. To see this, change the initial condition, under <span class='click_sequence'>{{ layout.equations }} → **Initial conditions**</span> so that $u\|_{t=0}$ has the value '**RAND**'.  Then press {{ layout.restart }} to restart the simulation. It should now exhibit patterns which are much more spot-like.

# Turing–Hopf bifurcations

We now vary the parameters from the previous simulation so that it supports both pattern formation, but also oscillations. These oscillations come from steady states undergoing [Hopf bifurcations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_bifurcation). In such regimes, one can often find a range of complex spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal behaviours, many of which can be simultaneously stable for different initial conditions. 

To illustrate this, we consider the initial conditions

$$
u(x,y,0) = \cos\left(\frac{m \pi x}{L}\right)\cos\left(\frac{m \pi y}{L}\right), \quad v(x,y,0)=0,
$$

for some integer $m$ and domain length $L=280$. 

* Load the [Turing-Hopf simulation](/sim/?preset=FitzHugh-Nagumo-Hopf)

* This simulation can display long-time solutions that exhibit all three kinds of behaviour, depending on the values of $m$, $D$, and the other parameters. Try $m=4$, $m=3$ and $m=6$ for example.

# Three-species variant

A three-species variant of the FitzHugh–Nagumo model is 

$$\begin{aligned}\pd{u}{t}&=\nabla^2 u +u-u^3-v,\\ \pd{v}{t}&=D_v\nabla^2v+ \varepsilon_v(u-a_v v-a_w w-a_z),\\ \pd{w}{t}&=D_w\nabla^2w+ \varepsilon_w(u-w).\end{aligned}$$

* Load the [three-species simulation](/sim/?preset=FitzHugh-Nagumo-3) 

* The simulation demonstrates the dynamics of this system in a regime which has both homogeneous limit cycles and pattern formation competing against one another.

* The initial pattern formed in this simulation will eventually be destroyed by the oscillations. You can increase the value of $a_v$ to stabilise the pattern for longer, and if $a_v \geq 0.3$, the pattern will eventually overtake the oscillations and fill the entire domain.
